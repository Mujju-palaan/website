        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Small and medium businesses should be able to afford high-end
          technology. Ensure that no one is left out of digitization due to a
          lack of IT skills. Make sure all the tools you need are under one roof
          called Tansy Cloud. It will be a continuous process of digitizing more
          and more business processes in order to boost quality and customer
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We help community members launch their software careers as part of our
          journey to digitize small and medium businesses. More on this at
          SEHAT.com
